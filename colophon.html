											<h3>How I made this site.</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This website was made for essentially no money and no overhead monthly cost by me, in about a week. 
                                            How did I do this and can I tell you? Here goes nothing.</p>
										<p><strong>I am lying about the no money part.</strong> Everything has a price, especially free things. 
                                            I used a template by a genius at <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a> to save me dealing with a site generator, and they are generous 
                                            enough to let me use this for free in exchange for attribution. I didn't design this website, just tweaked 
                                            a good design by a talented, generous person. I just checked. This whole website is in a folder that takes up 40MB, that is including the backup of my old site and a bunch of theme and image files I don't need. There are two main pages anyone can navigate to, the home page and this one. </p>
										<p><strong>I register my domain name with <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover.com</a>, and host this website on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</strong> 
                                            Why GitHub? Well, I don't anticipate getting an excess of traffic to this page so bandwidth is no concern. 
                                        <p>Every website has to buy bulk internet bandwidth, and the more a site gets visited and utilized 
                                            (eg. YouTube.com) the more the bill is, same as a cell data plan. YouTube has to pay probably in 
                                            the tens of millions a MONTH just to keep the petabytes of video bandwidth flowing. This little 
                                            digital business card might get ten views a month and six of them are me getting my resume, which 
                                            is certainly far below a gigabyte of bandwidth, an insignificant amount to any webhost's bottom line. 
                                            GitHub hosts thousands of projects and have users that pay for higher usage and they seem to have 
                                            no problem giving away hosting to the tiny users that muddle around experimenting with code, 
                                            contributing suggestions, and perhaps gaining a good reason to upgrade to the next tier. There are 
                                            also foundations that support GitHub because of education and progress in technology.</p>
                                        <p>Am I taking advantage? Yes. Am I selling anything that is absolutely dependant on this webpage? 
                                            No, I could use something else and in fact I do have a private hosting account at 
                                            Laughing Squid for my sheet music files that I pay for (to the tune of $6 per month). 
                                            I prefer to use GitHub so I can keep easy access to this site's files and edit them away 
                                            from my laptop. If they bill me or tell me to stop then I will. Until then, I'm very grateful 
                                            to them for this service.</p>
                                        <p><strong>What about the photos?</strong> Well, I paid for some of those shoots, and others were taken by friends, 
                                            family, photography students needing a model, and in one case a professional shoot for a symphony 
                                            I play in. For my tax bracket, there's no way I can honestly say I gain anything other than an ego 
                                            boost from these shots. If I start making making a decent or even decadent wage, I'll gladly 
                                            go back to the photographers I got a killer deal from and say "I'd like to either do another 
                                            shoot or properly compensate you for this work, since I'm suddenly popular and a rock star." 
                                            or something. Check the bottom of the homepage for attributions.</p>
										<p><strong>What about the coding?</strong> I read a couple books on HTML before I went to university. 
                                            After I graduated I took a look at the web again and realized I had missed quite a few trains (or 
                                            warp drive time travel ships). HTML used to be all the web was, apart from a spinning floppy 
                                            disk icon and maybe some flashing text. It still is, with a huge amount of extended code running 
                                            deep underneath serving up blog posts, flashy menus, animations, rss feeds, Google ad-sense 
                                            scripts and other things I don't need. I wanted a personal webpage that used no behind the 
                                            scenes horsepower and no languages that I didn't need to use. The template you see uses HTML5, 
                                            CSS, and some Javascript that I stay out of for fear of breaking it. I can edit HTML in my 
                                            sleep and CSS doesn't need anything done with it past the initial setup. There's another lie 
                                            for you. You have to go learn a tiny bit of code to deal with this. Find HTML for Dummies in a 
                                            public library booksale and read it. You'll either figure it out or you'll decide it ain't 
                                            for ya. Cost: $0-10 for the book and a few hours of reading... or $$ per month to a sitebuilder 
                                            that may not exist in 5 years. Better yet, download <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> and visit <a href="http://w3cschools.com/">w3cschools.com</a></p>
                                        <p><strong>What about blogging?</strong> or Facebook and YouTube? I don't tend to write my thoughts down 
                                            publically, at least not at the moment. Facebook might be good for some cases but I simply 
                                            don't want to be on that site constantly to run my business. I would prefer to pay for privacy 
                                            and professionalism rather than being fed advertisements for vitamins and white supremacy
                                            as I explain that "yes, of COURSE we can play Patchabell's Cannon for you." Same with YouTube. 
                                            I've seen talented people be skewered by 
                                            false promises of advertisement revenue as YouTube realized hubris wouldn't turn it 
                                            into the new and sharp replacement of Local Television, but into a very cheap way for large 
                                            businesses to get free marketing by stringing talent along until breaking point. I use 
                                            YouTube because it's convenient, but one more copyright claim for a piece by a centuries dead 
                                            dude because I play well enough to be matched by a robot to Gil Shaham's recording and I'm out. 
                                            YouTube is also deeply guilty of capitalizing Yankee social prudishness, where a beautiful human body
                                            is censored while violence and bigotry is allowed to florish and generate ad revenue.
                                            Vimeo is a service that is honest about how much video hosting costs, charging for storage and 
                                            bandwidth and features rather than stealing your content. They doesn't censor content, and are
                                            much higher quality than YouTube.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Can I make a webpage for you?</strong> No. Trust me, I'll mess it up. Get a professional or do it yourself.
                                            The reason I did things this way was it was cheap and a fun project to keep my mind off my garbage intonation.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Why bother saying all this?</strong> Because I don't want to think about the details
                                             of the internet and writing this was theraputic. Musicians and artists who have had their work stolen and devailued by
                                            unscrupulous internet firms and content pawn brokers will have the last laugh. When something goes wrong 
                                            with the free stolen content providers the only way to get good art or music will be to, 
                                            shocker, find an artist to hire for their services.
                                            I believe it is pointless to waste too much energy fighting injustice on such a cheap platform. When a major TV 
                                            show gets compromised and  hackers threaten to leak episodes early, no-one cares. Why? Because the people that matter, 
                                            professionals, artists, writers, actors, musicians, photographers, dudes who were shot out 
                                            of cannons, die-hard fans who appreciate skill and virtuosity; those people know the 
                                            hackers didn't create the show. If you made something good, give it away on YOUR, not 
                                        Silicon Valley's, terms.</p>
