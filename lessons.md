### Lessons with Noah
I teach violin at [Alcorn Music Studios](http://www.alcornmusicstudios.com) in the Little Italy neighborhood of Ottawa, and at [Domenic's Academy of Music](http://domenicsmusic.ca) in Orleans.
If either of these locations would work for you or your child, please contact them to arrange a lesson time.
### How I teach
I use the traditional methods of violin teaching that I was raised on, using simple etude, scale and repertoire books. I can also use Suzuki and RCM curricula.

### Instruments
For any beginning student, the most economical way to acquire an instrument is through renting from a reputable music store. Avoid purchasing an instrument before consulting with a violin teacher. Instruments must be sized correctly and set-up correctly, and rentals come with repair plans to cover damage and warrantee issues.

Used violins from Kijiji, well-meaning relatives, or internet dealers are VERY OFTEN, (though not universally) poorly made or in bad condition, and the cost of repairing them or the time spent in lesson trying to work around their problems is detrimental to learning.

Note: You almost definitely do NOT have a Stradivarius in your closet.

 In Ottawa I recommend [The Sound Post](https://www.thesoundpost.com/en/about/ottawa "Sound Post") or [Long and McQuade](https://www.long-mcquade.com/location/Ontario/Ottawa/ "Long and McQuade") for rentals and purchases of bowed string instruments.
